# OrbitalPlus

OrbitalPlus is a Discord bot made in .Net Core using the DSharp Discord API Wrapper. 
The purpose of this bot is to provide University related help in a Computer Science student Discord server.

### What can it do?
So far the bot will notify in a channel within the server approximately 30 minutes (give or take 5 minutes), before a lecture or a tutorial starts, if you opt into `Lecture Alerts` you will be pinged when this happens. There are a lot of plans for the future of this bot and I'm open to suggestions via DM. Development is already underway for displaying the days until the next assignment or exam due date along with feedback return dates.

### Commands:

This bot is still under development and more commands / functionality will be added in the near future...

#### Prefixes: `@HallamCSHelp`, `!o `, `!OrbitalPlus `

(Command prefixes are NOT case-sensitive, write it however you like.)

| Command | What it does |
| ------ | ------ |
| `ping` | Tests the response time of a request to the bot from the server  |
| `commands` or `help` | Will link this github repo |
| `date` | Prints current server date & time |
| `alerts` | Will explain how to set up `Lecture Alerts` |
